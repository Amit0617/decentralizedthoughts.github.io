This post is about the work of Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta from 1991 [How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document](https://www.anf.es/pdf/Haber_Stornetta.pdf) and their followup paper [Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of Digital Time-Stamping](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.71.4891&rep=rep1&type=pdf). These two papers are one of the eight papers cited by the [bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

The ideas of this paper have been in use from 1995 by [Surety](http://www.surety.com/solutions/intellectual-property-protection/sign-seal). This makes it the longest-running blockchain! Here is a photo from 2018 of Stuart Haber with the hash circled in red on the NYT
