Brainstorm:

So you're a cryptocurrency enthusiast and you keep reading about these _hash functions_, but you have no clue what they are.
You've come to the right place.
In this article, I'll give you: a simple mental model of hash functions, several cool applications of hash functions, 

can use pictures to describe all of these:
deterministic: putting in the same input gives you the same output, as opposed to randomized (give an example?)
compressing: large input, small output
collision-resistant:
one-way:
random:

Subtle interrelatedness of these properties:


### Applications

See my own post: https://people.csail.mit.edu/alinush/6.857-spring-2015/l05-hash-1.html

## Proof of work

## Commitments

We are all chatting on Slack.
It turns out Bob wants to sell his TV to the highest bidder.
So we want to have a sealed-bid auction on Slack: i.e., (1) everybody posts their sealed bid, (2) everybody reveals their bid, (3) the highest bidder gets the TV.
