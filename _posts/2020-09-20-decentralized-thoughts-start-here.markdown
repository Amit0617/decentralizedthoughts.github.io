# The basics of distributed computing

Start with the definition of [Consensus and Agreement](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-27-defining-consensus/). Then learn about the [network model](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/), the [threshold adversary](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-17-the-threshold-adversary/ model), and the [power of the adversary]
(https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/). 
Fianlly, many protocol need a [trusted setup phase](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-07-18-setup-assumptions/).

You can learn more about (Partial Synchrony)[https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-09-13-flavours-of-partial-synchrony/] and about different [flavours of Broadcast](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-10-22-flavours-of-broadcast/).
