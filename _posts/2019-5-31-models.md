title: The three basic models

When trying to understnad distributed computing, you have to start with the three basic models: Synchrony, Asynchrony and Partial Synchrony.

TL;DR; lets start with simple definitions.

In the basic **Synchronious model** the assumption is that there exists some known finite time bound $\Delta$. For any message sent, the adversary can delay its delivery by at most $\Delta$.

In the **Asynchronoius model**, for any message sent, the adversary can delay its delivery by any finite amount of time. On the one hand there is no bound on the time to deliver but on the other hand the message must eventually be delived.

The **Partial synchrony model** aims to find a compromise beteen these two models. The assumption is that there exists some known finite time bound $\Delta$ and a special event called GST (Global Stabilization Time) such that:
* The adversary must cause the GST event to eventually happen after some some finite (but unknown) time. 
* Any message sent at time $x$ must be deliverd by time $\max \{x,GST\} + \Delta$.
Informally,  the system behaves asynchronously till GST and synchronously after GST. Note that adversary delay the GST by any finite amount of time and that no protocol can detect that GST has occured.
