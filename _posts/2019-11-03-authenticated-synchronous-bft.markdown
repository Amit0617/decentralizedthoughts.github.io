Different modeling assumptions under which we construct BFT protocols often make it hard to compare two protocols and understand their relative contributions. In this post we discuss *[synchronous](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/)* protocols in the *[authenticated](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-07-18-setup-assumptions/)* model (assuming a PKI). 

A protocol runs in the [synchronous model](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/) if it assumes a **bounded message delay**, i.e., all messages will arrive within a bounded delay of $\Delta$. A common strengthening of synchronous model is *lock-step* synchrony, i.e., replicas execute the protocol in rounds in a synchronized manner. A message sent at the start of a round arrives by the end of the round.

### Is the synchronous model practical?
The short answer is, it's hard to say. For practitioners, the synchrony assumption may seem strong for several reasons. First, if the bounded-message delay assumption does not hold *even* for a single message between honest parties, then we may have a safety violation. Second, lock-step execution may be hard to implement in practice. Finally, waiting for multiple rounds/$\Delta$â€™s implies a high latency to commit. On the other hand, research in the synchronous setting has been improving all of these aspects to bring synchrony closer to practice.

### The advantage of synchrony: tolerating a minority corruption
The [DLS](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-25-on-the-impossibility-of-byzantine-agreement-for-n-equals-3f-in-partial-synchrony/) lower bound implies that we can tolerate at most one-third corruption with weaker assumptions such as partial synchrony/asynchrony. 
The synchronous model, together with digital signatures or PoW, can tolerate up to minority corruption.

### Comparing authenticated synchronous BFT protocols
To evaluate and compare authenticated synchronous protocols we analyze them in the following dimensions:
1. *Consensus definition.* Whether the protocol was intended to solve Byzantine Broadcast ([BB](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-27-defining-consensus/)), Byzantine Agreement ([BA](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-27-defining-consensus/)), or State Machine Replication ([SMR](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-10-15-consensus-for-state-machine-replication/)).
2. *Lock-step vs bounded-message delay.* Whether the protocol requires a lock-step execution of replicas, or can they  rely only on bounded-message delay.
3. *Latency to commit.* For protocols with lock-step execution, the (expected) latency is measured in the number of \#rounds to commit. For protocols which only assume bounded-message delay, the (expected) latency in measured in terms of $\Delta$. For protocols in SMR that use the [steady-state-and-view-change paradigm](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-10-15-consensus-for-state-machine-replication/), we mention the latency as a tuple of (steady state time to commit, expected time to arrive at the next steady state through view changes).
4. *Communication complexity.* The (expected) number of signatures sent by honest parties. Wherever applicable, the message complexity is described assuming the presence of threshold signatures.
5. *Optimistic responsiveness (OR).* Some protocols can commit in time independent of $\Delta$ when certain *optimistic* conditions hold. e.g., the actual number of Byzantine behaving parties is less than $n/4$. We will discuss this further in a separate post.
6. *Adaptive adversary.* Is the protocol resilient to an [adaptive adversary](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/)?

\* The protocol by Micali and Vaikuntanathan requires $\kappa$ rounds where $\kappa$ is a statistical security parameter and obtains a "player replaceability" notion of adaptive security.

\*\* PiLi and Sync HotStuff also handle a weaker synchrony model with *mobile sluggish faults*.

**Lock-step execution vs. bounded-message delay.** As can be seen in the latency column, lock-step protocols express latency in terms of \#rounds, whereas non-lock-step protocols in terms of $\Delta$. 
This distinction is minor in theory (or asymptotically) because one can obtain lock-step execution from a bounded message delay assumption, by merely using a *clock synchronization* protocol such as [Dolev et al.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.499.2250&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and [Abraham et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1028.pdf).
Specifically, these protocols have $O(n^2)$ message complexity and can synchronize honest parties' clocks within $\Delta$ time.
Thus, using rounds of duration $2\Delta$ suffices to implement lock-step execution. 
However, state-of-art non-lock-step protocols can achieve lower latency by avoiding such transformations. 

**Remark.** All protocols derived from Nakamoto consensus rely on synchrony. We will discuss them separately in a later post.
